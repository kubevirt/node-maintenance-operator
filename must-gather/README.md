# Collecting node-maintenance related debug data

You can use the `oc adm must-gather` command to collect information about your cluster.

With the  node-maintenance must-gather image you can collect manifests and logs related to node maintenance,
which includes the node objects, and logs and manifests related to the node-maintenance-operator.

To collect this data, you must specify the extra image using the `--image` option.
Example:

```bash
oc adm must-gather --image=quay.io/kubevirt/lifecycle-must-gather:latest
```
